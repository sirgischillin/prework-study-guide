# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created to help students in the Columbia University Bootcamp to study their notes. The notes on the webpage are broken down into four topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript with each topic containing notes pertaining to it. The purpose of this project is to help students organize their notes, making it easier for them to read.

## Usage

There are four sections with notes for each topic on the webpage: HTML, CSS, Git, and Javacript. A student can easily access these notes to study, and if a student can't decide which notes to study first, we have Javscript running to help the student make a decision. If you open the DevTools Console, which can be accessed by pressing Command+Option+I for MacOS or Control+Shift+I for Windows, you'll see a control panel open below or to the side of the browser. There, you'll see a list of topics that were covered in the BootCamp along with a topic to study first. If you refresh the page, the topic to study first may change at random.
